# Introduction
***
**[CWire](https://cwire.io)** helps you to build internal application (like administration tools, dashboards, ...) with less code.

### Why should I use CWire?
***
We believe that internal frontends are important for successful projects, but it's very hard and frustrating to build and maintaining good internal frontends.
To solve this issues, we build an easy to integrate SDK on top of your favourite tools and an easy-to-use frontend to build custom frontends, dashboards and business automations.

### Getting Started
***
To setup CWire please following guides for you technologies. If you want to start completely from scratch please follow our [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start):
