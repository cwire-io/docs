# Introduction
***
**[CWire](https://cwire.io)** helps you to build internal application (like administration tools, dashboards, ...) with less code.

### Why should I use CWire?
***
We believe that Internal frontends are imported for successfully projects, but it's very hard and frustrating to build or maintaining good internal frontends. To solve this issues, we build an easy to integrate SDK on the Top of your favourite Tools and an easy-to-use Frontend to build custom frontends, dashboards and business automations.

### Getting Started?
