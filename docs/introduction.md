# Introduction
***
**[CWire](https://cwire.io)** helps you to build internal applications like dashboards and administration tools with less code.
At the same time we value the way developers work and integrate with usual backend environments.


### Why should I use CWire?
***
We believe that internal frontends are important for successful projects, but it's very hard and frustrating to build and maintaining good internal frontends.
To solve this issues, we build an easy to integrate SDK on top of your favourite tools and an easy-to-use frontend to build custom frontends, dashboards and business automations.

### Getting Started
