## What is cwire?
[cwire](https://cwire.io) is a free software that helps you to build dashboards and admin panels for any company. Our 
approach is to deliver a developer-first and highly customizable experience to build company internal software with 
less effort.

## How cwire works
With our SDK you easily integrate [cwire](https://cwire.io) on your server to retrieve your data and define your 
business use cases. Afterwards, we provide an auto generated user interface you can access from your browser and share 
with your colleagues.

## Why should I use cwire?
[cwire](https://cwire.io) helps you to build internal application like administration tools and dashboards with
less code. We believe that internal frontends are important for successful projects, but it can be very time-consuming 
to build and maintain. To help solve this issue, we are building an easy to integrate SDK to build custom frontends, 
dashboards and business automations.
