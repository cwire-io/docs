## What is cwire?

## How cwire works

## Why should I use cwire?

**[cwire](https://cwire.io)** helps you to build internal application like administration tools and dashboards with
less code.


We believe that internal frontends are important for successful projects, but it's very hard and frustrating to build or
maintain good internal frontends. To solve this issue, we build an easy to integrate SDK on the top of your favourite
tools and an easy-to-use frontend to build custom frontends, dashboards and business automations.

## Getting Started
