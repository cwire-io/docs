# Basics
The CWire Architecture based on the core idea of easy understandable implementation.
For this we decided to build server side SDK's for developers to make the implementation process simple.
(For now, we only provide a [NodeJS SDK](https://github.com/cwire-io/nodejs-sdk), but more are in planing).
This SDK's will connect to our CWire API and create WebSocket Connection to set up the
communication bridge between your backend and our infrastructure.
